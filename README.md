## About this App
This is an applcation that allows the user to make a state selection from a list. Upon selection, the user is presented with a list of the top ten trending items in that state. Each trending item is linked to a corresponding twitter page for that trend. When the user scrolls down, they are presented with a map. When they click on a state in the map, they are presented with the top trending item in the state they have clicked upon as well as the corresponding link.

## Improtant Note!
Due to CORS errors from sending requests from the localhost, a workaround from https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere was used. However, this workaround only fucntions after you "request temporary access to the demo server" at https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo

 Without visiting this site, the App will not work as inteneded. In the future with more node.js knowledge, this may be corrected using npm cors.
